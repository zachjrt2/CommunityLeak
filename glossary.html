MANA VALLEY - Core Concept Document
====================================
Date: 2019-04-15
Status: ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

Core Mechanic: Resource management meets exploration
Theme: Energy as a living, flowing entity
Inspiration: Stardew Valley, Breath of the Wild

The player must balance:
- Mana collection (primary resource)
- Valley exploration (finding new places)
- Entity relationships (diplomacy/combat)

DESIGN PILLARS:
1. Flow - Energy should feel alive
2. Choice - Multiple paths to victory
3. Consequence - Actions ripple through the valley

Color Palette Research:
#434F52 - Primary
#455354 - Secondary
#544845 - Cave Rocks
#45414C - Witches heart
#504841 - Field Grain
#554E44 - Corrupted Mana
#495346 - Nona's Amulet
#415445 - Pomplu Leaf
#4C4F57 - Basic Rocks
#554E44 - Corrupted Mana
#455253 - Pomplu Soul
#4B4559 - Cave Lighting
#434F52 - Amberfin Ash
#455253 - Mana Essence
#554E44 - Ocean Floor (Night)

Developer note:
These hex values are not random — they hide letters if read as ASCII.
Each pair of digits (e.g., 4D → M) forms a word.

If decoded correctly, they reveal a keyword needed for the energy system.
Try starting with the Primary color and follow the same process for the others.
When finished, check the system logs for where to use it.

        "mana_valley/design_doc.md": `
## World Building

The valley exists in multiple states simultaneously.
Players experience different "frequencies" of reality.

Stage 1:
Cave exploration should expand the usability of the map and lay foundations for
mining.
[Implement]
    - Cave Rocks
    - Cave Lighting
Stage 2:
Nona needs some more story and her house could use a little landscaping.
[Implement] 
    - Nona's Amulet
    - Basic Rocks
Stage 3:
Redo the color balancing on the world to help unify the design language.
[Color Considerations]
    - Ocean Floor (Night)
    - Mana Essence
    - Primary
    - Secondary
    - Pomplu Leaf
Stage 4:
New inventory system to help players gather and interact with items in the world
[Items to make stackable]
    - Corrupted Mana
    - Pomplu Soul
    - Amberfin Ash
    - Witches heart
    - Field Grain

Internal note:
The Alpha Flow shows unique synchronization behavior.
Terminal access for Alpha testing requires correct state identification.

## Cross-Project Notes
Strange... the mana flow patterns match the clone distribution in Pixel Labs.
Is there a connection? Check .archive for memory fragments.

BURGER RIOT - Playtesting Session #47
=====================================
Date: 2023-06-22
Build: v0.8.3-alpha

PLAYTESTER: Mike K.
Session Duration: 23 minutes

Timestamp Log:
00:00 - Game start, tutorial skipped
00:15 - First burger assembled
00:43 - Customer #1 satisfied
01:12 - Speed boost activated
01:58 - "Riot mode" triggered (chaos event)
02:34 - Multi-order juggling (3 simultaneous)
03:11 - First failure (burnt burger)
03:45 - Recovery, back to normal speed
04:23 - High score achieved: 1,250 points

BUGS FOUND:
- Burger sometimes clips through counter
- Sound effect delay on "perfect" orders
- Riot mode difficulty spike too harsh

NOTES:
Mike mentioned the game has a "rhythm" to it.
The timestamps feel musical? Need to analyze.

[INTERNAL]: Check riot_trigger_sequence.wav
Pattern analysis suggests morse-like intervals...

Funny coincidence: The chaos in riot mode feels similar to 
the destruction mechanics in Suspended. Same energy, different context.

INDIE DEV 500 - The Journey
============================

A game about making games.
A race to be remembered.
7 developers.
Infinite coffee.

This project is a love letter to the indie dev grind.
Every bot made by a contestent represents a real struggle:
- Resource management = Time & complexity
- Physics Unpredictabilaty = Life happening  
- Node structure = Learning new skills
- Time Limit = Crunch time

The game was built to break you.
It knows when you're struggling.
It adapts.

TO DECRYPT THE DEV JOURNAL:
1. Find the encryption key (it's hidden in the other projects)
2. Use the decrypt_tool.sh script
3. Prepare yourself for the truth

Hint: The key is made of ANSWERS you've already found.

Note: The archive folder has strange memory fragments.
They talk about connections between all the projects.
Maybe that's the real final puzzle?

# Research Log - Clone Efficiency

## Discovery
The clones aren't just following programmed paths.
They're exhibiting emergent behavior.

## Pattern Recognition
When I map their movement patterns, they form LETTERS.
Not random. Intentional.

## Hypothesis
The lab simulation is leaking data from other projects.
The clones are trying to communicate something.

## Hint for Future Me
If you're stuck on coordinate systems in other projects,
remember: Everything is connected through position data.

Row 4, Column 3 = ?
Row 1, Column 4 = ?

Think GRID. Think ASCII. Think LETTERS.

Game: Follow verbal directions or die trying

FAILURE ANALYSIS - Simon's Hallway
===================================

Most Common Death Points:
1. Direction 5 (Backward movement) - 67% deaths
2. Direction 7 (Final step) - 21% deaths  
3. Direction 3 (Forward 5) - 12% deaths

Analysis:
Players struggle with TIMING more than direction.
The game isn't about spatial awareness.
It's about RHYTHM and PATTERN RECOGNITION.

Recommendation: Add visual metronome?
Or accept that this is a rhythm game disguised as a puzzle game.

[DEV NOTE]: 
The morse code interpretation was right.
If you break the directions into beats...
And map the pause durations to dots and dashes...

You get a MESSAGE.

Defend the fortress from hordes of blood-red goblins.

MANA.

Mana Valley uses mana as a resource.
Mana God uses mana as a weapon.

They're connected.

## Energy System
- Mana Pool: 100 units (starting)
- Mana Regeneration: 5 per second
- Spell Costs: 10-50 mana

The energy flow... it's the same algorithm.
I literally copied the code from Mana Valley.

But it FEELS different in context.
Tower defense vs resource management.

Same system. Different experience.

## Revelation
All my games use MANA as the core resource.
Even when I call it something else:
- Energy (Valley)
- Time (Burger Riot)  
- Momentum (Simon's Hallway)
- Resources (Indie Dev)

It's all the same.

# Chaos Theory in Game Design

## Observation
Every game I make has a chaos element:
- Burger Riot: Riot mode
- Suspended: Destruction scoring  
- Desktop Village: Twitch chat interference
- Mana Valley: Energy overflow events

## Pattern
The chaos follows mathematical patterns.
It LOOKS random but isn't.

## Realization  
I keep implementing the same chaos algorithm.
Different variables. Same structure.

Pseudocode:
\`\`\`
chaos_value = base_value * (1 + random(0.5, 2.0))
if chaos_value > threshold:
    trigger_cascade_event()
\`\`\`

The cascade events trigger at SPECIFIC intervals.
Not random.

The intervals match MORSE CODE timing.
- Short pulse: 0.5s
- Long pulse: 2.0s

Did I do this on purpose?
Or is my subconscious encoding messages in my games?

[HINT FOR BURGER RIOT PUZZLE]:
If you're stuck on the timing puzzle,
remember that chaos has rhythm.
The intervals between chaos events = morse code.

- Simon's Hallway <-> Burger Riot (timing systems linked)

Root Cause: Unknown
Recommendation: Full system reset

But wait... what if this ISN'T a bug?

What if the projects WANT to connect?
What if there's a message hidden in the connections?

See memory_fragments.log for details.

MEMORY FRAGMENT ANALYSIS
=========================
Analyzing cross-project data leaks...

Fragment 001: COORDINATE SYSTEM
---------------------------------
Recurring coordinates across all projects:
Position (4,13) appears in:
  - Mana Valley energy_system.log
  - Pixel Labs clone_data.csv
  - Mana God goblin_ai.txt
  - Suspended school_layout.txt

Position (1,14) appears in:
  - [same files as above]

These aren't bugs. They're ANCHORS.
Reference points connecting all projects.

If we treat them as a GRID COORDINATE SYSTEM:
Row 4, Column 13 = Letter ?
Row 1, Column 14 = Letter ?

Using 1-indexed grid where A=1, B=2...
Row 4 = D
Row 1 = A  
Column 13 = M
Column 14 = N

But how do we combine them?
(Row, Column) = (D,M)? DM?
Or Column, Row = (M,D)? MD?

Fragment 002: TIMING PATTERNS  
-------------------------------
All projects share timing signatures:
- 0.5s intervals (SHORT)
- 1.0s intervals (MEDIUM)
- 2.0s intervals (LONG)

Morse code mapping:
SHORT = . (dot)
LONG = - (dash)  
MEDIUM = (letter separator)

Simon's Hallway timing: . - . . - . -
Burger Riot timestamps: - . - - . . - .
Suspended chaos events: . . - . - - .

These spell words when decoded properly.

Fragment 003: THE CONNECTION
-----------------------------
All projects are connected through:
1. Shared coordinate system
2. Shared timing patterns
3. Shared MANA/energy algorithms

Hypothesis:
The developer's subconscious created a META-PUZZLE
spanning all their games.

The individual games are CHAPTERS.
Together, they tell a complete story.

Fragment 004: THE MESSAGE
--------------------------
[CORRUPTED - Requires all 3 main puzzles solved]

Fragment 005: YOUR ROLE
------------------------
You're not just solving puzzles.
You're reconstructing the developer's creative journey.

Every coordinate is a brushstroke.
Every timing pattern is a rhythm.
Every energy system is a heartbeat.

The games are alive.
And they're speaking to you.
